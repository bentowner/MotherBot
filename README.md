# MotherBot - AWS Chatbot submission

**MotherBot** helps by Sharing Calendars, Approved Contacts and provides a self-service administration platform for the C.E.O. of the Home to effectively schedule and organize.  The AWS Chat Bot allows various processes to be made available to these household with the primary purpose of verifying the identity of the individual connections, formalizing an approval process and managing the ‘feasibility’ on the calendar.

## **Uniqueness**

Households are like mini-organizations, except their members or ‘little users’ often find themselves in a place of constant challenge and response.  Seeking approval and then finding out how to facilitate getting it done is the world that ‘Tweens’ live in.  The coordination required among Parents often requires effective communication practices regardless of your Work-life or Marital status.  Technology can enable Parents or Parental guardians to manage the household workloads while providing an appropriate level of privacy and respect.
